# ABOUT

This project is an example of a trading card of my favorite animal. It was drawn using basic elements of both HTML and CSS, and was my first attempt at a real project.

## How to Display

To run the code, simply double-click the `card.html` file inside the main folder, and it should show a preview automatically inside your default browser.

Or alternatively:

* Right Click `card.html`
* Select Open With >
* Choose your preferred Internet Browser
